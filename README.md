# Custom Password Generator

## How It Works

This website allows the user to create a random password through a series of questions. To initialize the process, the "Generate Password" button must be clicked. The user will then be prompted to select a character length for their password (ranging between 8 and 128). The password can be customized to the user's preference in the choice of whether to use the following characters in their password:

 - lower case letters
 - upper case letters
 - numbers
 - special characters

 Once these preferences have been filled, the generator will randomly select characters based on the length and character-type chosen by user, and combine them to form a password.
 
 The generator will display the user's new password inside the bordered display box above the "Generate Password" button. If the user does not like their given password, they may re-start the process in order to receive a new randomly generated password.
